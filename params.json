This is achieved by a simulation-based approach, similar to the Bayesian p-value or the parametric bootstrap: 1) simulate new data from the fitted model 2) from this simulated data, calculate the cummulative density function  3) residual is the value of the empirical density function at the value of the observed data. More on the appraoch\r\n\r\n* In the DHARMa vignette (see below)\r\n* A blog post [here](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2016/08/28/dharma-an-r-package-for-residual-diagnostics-of-glmms/)\r\n* A poster for the 2016 GFÃ– conference [here](https://florianhartig.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dharma.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Getting DHARMa\r\n\r\n### From CRAN \r\n\r\nDHARMa is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/index.html). So, to install the latest major release, just run \r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ninstall.packages(\"DHARMa\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get an overview about its functionality once the package is installed, run\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(DHARMa)\r\n?DHARMa\r\nvignette(\"DHARMa\", package=\"DHARMa\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development release \r\n\r\nIf you want to install the current (development) version from this repository, run\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"DHARMa\", username = \"florianhartig\", subdir = \"DHARMa\", dependencies = T)\r\n```\r\nBelow the status of the automatic Travis CI tests on the master branch\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/florianhartig/DHARMa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/florianhartig/DHARMa)\r\n\r\n### Older releases\r\n\r\nTo install a specific (older) release, decide for the version number that you want to install in [https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases](https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases) (version numbering corresponds to CRAN, but there may be smaller releases that were not pushed to CRAN) and run \r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"DHARMa\", username = \"florianhartig\", subdir = \"DHARMa\", ref = \"v0.0.2.1\")\r\n```\r\nwith the appropriate version number. \r\n",
